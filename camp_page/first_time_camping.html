                <p>Hey Y'all! This is my first blog post about starting my camping journey. This is my first time ever camping so I
                    don't want to be judged for the decisions I made. We all settle into things differently and this is my journey.
                    With that out of the way, my first time camping...*drumroll please*... was glamping in my boyfriend's backyard.</p>
                <p>"What is glamping?" some of y'all might be asking. Well, let me tell you. Glamping is glamorous camping. Meaning
                    you camp in a more glorious way than most would, whether that be in a camper, a cabin, with an air mattress, etc.
                    My version of glamping was sleeping in a ten-person tent, with a queen-sized air mattress, pillows, and a power
                    strip running from the house... so we could plug in fairy lights and charge his laptop to watch the first Twilight
                    film.</p>
                <p>My takeaway from this new experience is that you know yourself better than anyone else and that you shouldn't push 
                    yourself into foreign territory in a manner you aren't okay with. I highly recommend that you glamp for your first time. 
                    I cannot wait to keep y'all posted about more of my camping adventures!</p>
