            <h2>Why A Camping Blog?</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Alexis but you can call me Lexis. Just to start things off, I had absolutely zero camping
                experience before I started this blogging journey. I bet you're wondering "Why would you create a camping blog with 
                no camping experience?" Well that's a simple question to answer!</p>
            <p>I love doing new things, and I also love to educate people. And what better way is there to learn something than doing
                it and teaching people how to do it? The added fear of the unknown implications my education will have on you is more
                than enough to make sure I stay on the right path with learning.</p>
            <p>In all seriousness, I have a deep passion for being outside and for leading by example. So that is why I decided to 
                create this website. I want to lead by example and get more people outdoors and camping. This journey will be long 
                and hard but I am looking forward to it with tons of enthusiasm</p>
