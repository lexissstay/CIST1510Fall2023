            <h2>Group Camping at Factory Shoals Georgia</h2>
            <p>Hey Y'all! This is going to be our second group camping event that I have hosted, and I am so excited for it. Now 
                there is no requirement to come along on this camping trip. I do strongly encourage that you have attended our 
                camping basics classes whether it was in person or virtual. This is only because I do not know how many people will 
                be coming as of yet.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in coming here are the details for the event. The group camp will be taking place over the 
                weekend of April thirteenth and fourteenth 2024. It will be taking place at Factory Shoals located at 450 Newton 
                Factory Bridge Rd, Covington, GA 30014. We will be arriving at 10:00 AM and leaving the next day at 3:00 PM.</p>
            <p>If you would like to join us on our camping trip please send me an <a href="mailto:lexis_nicole78@hotmail.com">email</a>!</p>
