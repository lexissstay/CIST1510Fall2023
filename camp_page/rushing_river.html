                <p> Hey Y'all! This adventure is about my first time camping near a natural body of water!!! One thing about me I have 
                    yet to mention is that I absolutely love water. Well, anything besides a lake. I just don't like how dirty the 
                    water can be and how stagnant it is. Either way, this was my first time camping by water and I was so excited for 
                    the peaceful sounds of the water rushing by.</p>
                <p>This trip my boyfriend and I camped in a two-person tent right next to the river. The sounds were phenomenal and 
                    made me sleep like a baby. When we woke up we decided to take a swim in the river to wake up. And then finished 
                    the trip off with a long and lovely hike through the surrounding wilderness.</p>
                <p>This has by far been my favorite camping trip and I will definitely be planning more destinations that involve 
                    water. This camping trip taught me the dangers of being near water which is mainly worrying about not being swept 
                    away, drowning, or interfering with hazardous wildlife like the water moccasin here in Georgia. I don't see how anyone 
                    could hate camping out near water, and this should definitely be something everyone should try. I cannot wait to go on 
                    more adventures and keep y'all updated and educated!</p>
