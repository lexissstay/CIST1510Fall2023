            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p >Hi everyone! As y'all already know, my name is Alexis, but you can call me Lexis. Let's cut to the chase, you are here to 
                learn more about me and why I am making this website. I am not shy to fess up to the fact that I don't have much camping 
                experience. But I am not scared of trying new things, and one of the best ways for me to learn something is to have some 
                pressure put on me, and to try my best to explain it to other people. So that is exactly what I am doing with this website. 
                I am here to educate y'all newbies about camping!!!</p>
            <p>Some get to know me. My name is Alexis, I am 21 years old, and I am from Georgia. Yes yes, I am a country girl. But trust 
                me, that does not give me an advantage with this whole camping path I have decided to go down. I am a prissy country 
                girl not one of the ones who can easily get their hands dirty. Most of the time you are lucky to get me outside for 
                longer than half an hour. So camping is definitely not my cup of tea. I am college educated and have already earned my 
                first of hopefully several degrees. I eventually plan on becoming some form of social sciences professor at a university 
                and starting a family. I've told y'all that I love to educate people, but I also love to be educated. Even when I am not 
                in school for a certain degree pathway, I am still enrolled and taking classes because I love knowledge so much. I am a 
                huge sucker for current events and doing synopses for historical events and showing how far they reach, even into the 
                modern day.</p>
            <p>The main goals I am trying to achieve with this website are: Developing my coding skills, going on tons of adventures, 
                learning new skills in camping and surviving outdoors, and most importantly, I want to make an impact with my camping 
                education and get some of y'all to come outside with me. I want more people to start leaving their homes and leaving 
                behind our modern world of technology. I feel like disconnecting from not only technology but social media as well is 
                great for improving our mental health as well as our physical health.</p>
