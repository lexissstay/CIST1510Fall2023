                <p>Hey Y'all! This adventure is about my first time using a hammock. Now, I am someone who can be deathly afraid of 
                    heights. Thinking about having to use a hammock had me fueled with nightmares about falling to my death out of 
                    them in the middle of the night. Granted, I tend to be a pretty big hypochondriac. So, with the fear cast aside, 
                    I set out to go camping with a hammock so I could get used to packing light.</p>
                <p>This time I was camping at my family's farm in the middle of nowhere in Pike County Georgia. My grandpa is the only
                    person that lives there so it was nice to go and see him on this camping trip. I set up my hammock on the fence of 
                    the property right next to the neighbor's house. The only reason I did this was because it was the only location I 
                    could find that had two trees that were close enough together for me to set up my hammock. I used these straps to 
                    secure the hammock, which came with carabiners, to the straps.</p>
                <p>I genuinely loved using the hammock so much. It felt like I was being cradled the whole time which was something 
                    I didn't know I needed. My favorite part of using a hammock is that since I was using a two-person hammock, I was 
                    able to close the hammock completely and tightly around me so it felt like my own enclosure pod. I highly recommend 
                    that you use a hammock for camping because it is such an amazing experience that I believe everyone should 
                    experience.</p>
